# Project-solar
 Allocation Optimization

The objective is to utilize Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find the optimal Percentage Generator Client (PGC) matrix, balancing solar energy supply and demand, reducing waste, and improving efficiency. By optimizing energy allocation, the aim is to enhance energy management and forecasting, promoting the effective use of renewable energy.

Objective: To find the optimal Percentage Generator Client (PGC) matrix. (The lower the objective function value, the better the PGC matrix)

Methods: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), random matrix, and BUFFET.
